The town has a post office, an emergency services crew, a volunteer police department, roads, houses, bars, \nclubs, restaurants, and hundreds of art installations and participatory \"theme camps\". \nAfter a week, the city is completely disassembled – much of it burned – leaving the stark, white desert exactly as \nbare as it had been when the event started.\n\nPS. Did you know that if one were to overlay it, Black Rock City would cover most of downtown San Francisco?\n",
