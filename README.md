# BRC Map (JavaScript Library)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brcmap/brcmapjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brcmap/brcmapjs)

This is a library for building live browser-based maps of [Burning Man](https://burningman.org/) festival. 

Features:

- Offline static maps that work without a server or internet connection
- Real-time data updates (e.g. art car locations) from internet or on-the-playa servers
- Display any data you want (provided in GeoJSON-based format)
- Use raster tiles (in OSM slippy-tile format) for off-the-playa locations
